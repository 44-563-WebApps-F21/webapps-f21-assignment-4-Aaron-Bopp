    <h4 class="name">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>
    <p class="marchmont speech">Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?</p>

    <h4 class="name">LADY BASILDON.</h4>
    <p class="basildon speech">I suppose so. Are you?</p>

    <h4 class="name">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>
    <p class="marchmont speech">Yes. Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>

    <h4 class="name">LADY BASILDON.</h4>
    <p class="basildon speech">Horribly tedious! Never know why I go. Never know why I go anywhere.</p>

    <h4 class="name">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>
    <p class="marchmont speech">I come here to be educated.</p>

    <h4 class="name">LADY BASILDON.</h4>
    <p class="basildon speech">Ah! I hate being educated!</p>

    <h4 class="name">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>
    <p class="marchmont speech">So do I. It puts one almost on a level with the commercial classes, doesn’t it? But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life. So I come here to try to find one.</p>

    <h4 class="name">LADY BASILDON.</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]</p>
    <p class="basildon speech">I don’t see anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose. The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole time.</p>

    <h4 class="name">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>
    <p> How very trivial of him!</p>

    <h4 class="name">LADY BASILDON.</h4>
    <p class="basildon speech">Terribly trivial! What did your man talk about?</p>

    <h4 class="name">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>
    <p class="marchmont speech">About myself.</p>

    <h4 class="name">LADY BASILDON.</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Languidly_.]</p>
    <p> And were you interested?</p>

    <h4 class="name">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Shaking her head_.]</p>
    <p> Not in the smallest degree.</p>

    <h4 class="name">LADY BASILDON.</h4>
    <p class="basildon speech">What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!</p>

    <h4 class="name">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Rising_.]</p>
    <p class="marchmont speech">And how well it becomes us, Olivia!</p>
